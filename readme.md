## CLI app

### Install

```
npm install --global pageres
```

*PhantomJS, which is used for generating the screenshots, is installed automagically, but in some [rare cases](https://github.com/Obvious/phantomjs/issues/102) it might fail to and you'll get an `Error: spawn EACCES` error. [Download](http://phantomjs.org/download.html) PhantomJS manually and reinstall pageres if that happens.*


### Usage

```
$ pageres --help

Get screenshots of websites in different resolutions.

Specify urls and screen resolutions as arguments. Order doesn't matter.

Usage
  pageres <url> <resolution> [<resolution> <url> ...]
  pageres [<url> <resolution> ...] < <file>
  cat <file> | pageres [<url> <resolution> ...]

Example
  pageres todomvc.com yeoman.io 1366x768,1600x900
  pageres 1366x768 < urls.txt
  cat screen-resolutions.txt | pageres todomvc.com yeoman.io

You can also pipe in a newline separated list of urls and screen resolutions which will get merged with the arguments.
If no screen resolutions are specified it will fall back to the ten most popular ones according to w3counter.
```


## Programmatic API

### Install

```
npm install --save pageres
```

### Example

```js
var pageres = require('pageres');

pageres(['todomvc.com'], ['1366x768', '1600x900'], function () {
	console.log('done');
});
```
